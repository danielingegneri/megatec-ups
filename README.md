megatec-ups
=============
Created this app to query my "Digitec" brand UPS from Jaycar Australia.

Found that this UPS speaks the Megatec protocol:

This app is to keep it as simple as possible.

NOTE: If you're interested in testing this with your compatible UPS, please let me 
know of the results, as my UPS does not appear to support features that involve time.
